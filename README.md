## Project title: *Actor's Line Learning tool*

### Student name: *Sudharsan Velraja*

### Student email: *sv223@student.le.ac.uk*

### Project description: 
*Learning lines is a fundamental challenge for actors. Usually, they rely on friends or colleagues to read the other parts while they practice their lines, receiving corrections when they make mistakes. This project aims to develop an AI-powered assistant that acts as a digital rehearsal partner. The system will use text-to-speech (TTS) technology to read out different parts using distinct voices and speech recognition to verify the actor's lines. The AI will detect errors and provide real-time corrections, helping actors practice independently. A user-friendly mobile app or web-based system will allow users to upload and manage scripts, define character roles, and rehearse efficiently. This project will involve the use of natural language processing (NLP) and simple UI design to create an effective and interactive rehearsal tool.*

### List of requirements (objectives): 

[comment]: # (You can add as many additional bullet points as necessary by adding an additional hyphon symbol '-' at the end of each list) 

Essential:
- Implement text-to-speech (TTS) to read scripts using distinct character voices to distinguish between characters
- Develop speech recognition to detect and evaluate an actorâ€™s spoken lines, identifying discrepancies in real-time
- Create a script storage system to store the uploaded script by the user
- Provide real-time feedback when an actor makes a mistake

Desirable:
- Design a user interface (UI) to allow users to upload, edit, and interact with their scripts in an intuitive manner
- Allow customizable voice settings like voice gender, pitch and speed to match the user's preferences and create an immersive rehearsal experience
- Implement a progress tracker for users to measure their improvement over time and providing insights

Optional:
- Offer collaborative rehearsal where multiple actors can practice together
- Generate performance reports, and track their rehearsal history
- Implement a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker UI for eye comfort during long practice sessions
- Allow users to customize the background colour of the script display, enabling options such as yellow or green backgrounds for improved readability and reduced eye strain
- Add an option to play the whole script with AI reading all the parts in sequence, allowing users to listen to and absorb the full script before practicing
- Enable users to take a picture of a hardcopy script and convert the script image to text for easy script management
